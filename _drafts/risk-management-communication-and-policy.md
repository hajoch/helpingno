**Background**

Data generated from FHI shows how immigrants from Pakistan, Somalia, Iraq and Eritrea are overrepresented in numbers of Covid infections and hospitalization. This has been a continuous problem during the pandemic in Norway. Why is this? And how may authorities communicate health-related risks more efficiently to these vulnerable groups creating better results?

In light of the Corona Commission’s review (part two) this paper will discuss how to efficiently communicate health risks to vulnerable immigrant groups and shed light on the challenges that follows. Genetic, socio-economic and cultural factors are highlighted in the review as a part of the explanation for the mentioned phenomenon. However, there is still no shared agreement between scientists.

This paper, because of its limitation in length, emphasizes and focuses on the potential for improvements when communicating with immigrant groups. Remember when reading, the Norwegian Authorities have made an incredible effort of protecting the public from an invisible hazard in a situation with weak evidence and knowledge. From an uncertainty-based risk perspective, they have managed to successfully teach the public in health-risk management and based on several conditions, like wealth and geography, Norway has come through the pandemic (so far) as one of the best handled countries. However, as the Corona Commission unveils, there have been judgemental mistakes in the process of risk communication with learning potential. Communicating uncertainty-based risks is a challenging balance as too much emphasis on the uncertainties may downplay the potential consequences. As Aven & Bouder (2020) states, establishing a communication and management based on risk science when handling a pandemic is of huge advantage. And the Norwegian Authorities have managed this in a good manner, though we could wish for a clearer lecture on the uncertainty concept to lay people.

**Structure  
**This paper is mainly based on part two of the Corona Commission report of 26th April 2022. This to make sure that an overall view of the authorities’ communication efforts during the pandemic is included in the discussion. Researching all the material independently would take up a lot of time.

This paper is structured by first presenting the topic question with FHI statistics shedding light on the differences between immigrant groups. Furthermore, addressing the findings of the Corona Commission where communication barriers with specific population groups illustrate the challenges of communicating health-related risks in a pandemic.

In order to discuss the risk communication of the Norwegian Authorities we need to establish the grounding elements of efficient risk communication: The concept of trust deserves a vital part explaining how trust is closely related to public response.

**1. Introduction  
**Overall the Corona Commission reviewed the handling of the covid pandemic by Norwegian authorities as well functioning: “_The government has been visible and active, and the authorities have made the majority of the population follow infection control measures, while maintaining the population's trust_“ (NOU, 2022, p. 447). However, when presenting in short their key findings on the Societal Safety Conference of 2022 by the University of Stavanger, group leader Egil Matsen mentioned an important aspect that sparks an interest from a risk communication standpoint.

Social and economic differences have increased in Norway during the pandemic (NOU, 2022) - not surprisingly this affects especially vulnerable groups of the population. Among what is characterized as vulnerable groups we find immigrants. This naturally because of differences in language and culture demanding a customized form of communication covering different concerns. This might partly explain the overrepresentation of infections and hospitalizations of immigrants FHI has seen since they first gathered data separating between population groups, to the present day. How do we however explain the drastic differences within the groups though? Immigrants from Pakistan, Somalia, Iraq and Eritrea have significantly higher levels of infections and hospitalizations. Why these population groups in particular?

Illustration (in Norwegian) of the significant dif erence in infection and hospitalization rate among specific immigrant groups compared with non-immigrants all the way to the left. Green post: Confirmed cases, blue post: hospitalizations. (NOU, 2022)_

Figure 1 covers the period of time from 21st of February 2020 until 30th of June 2021, and illustrates how immigrant groups from Eastern European countries have significantly lower numbers. Statistics from FHI reads that covid-related deaths of immigrants from Africa are six times higher in the age group 60+ than the population in the same age group without immigrant background. As for Asian immigrants the number is 3,6 times higher (NOU, 2022, p. 393). From the statistics we may therefore clearly isolate the problem to immigrants from these two world regions.

When analyzing these datasets we need to consider the amount of people representing each group. From Indseth et al. (2021), supported by SSB (2022) (Norwegian Central Bureau for Statistics), these groups are in the size of 18.000 to 29.000, where Somalia is the biggest selected group of immigrants. Additionally to these numbers are what SSB refers to as second generation immigrants which are collected in the group of Norwegian-born citizens with immigrant backgrounds. The Covid statistics of this population group are considerably lower, however still high in terms of other population groups. It might be of interest in defining which immigrant background (country-wise) this group actually has, to further analyze if there are similar differences in the second generation immigrants.

Looking to countries like Denmark and the UK the tendency seemed in autumn 2020 the same, where there was an “_overrepresentation of infected cases and hospitalizations among Black and Asian residents_” (Indseth et al, 2021, p.53). The health article of Indseth discusses the reasons for this, which might involve genetic factors when faced with the virus’ characteristics. Different immigrant groups rather more than the rest of the public may have different needs of physiological character living in northern countries where there is less sunshine resulting in lower levels of vitamin D. It has been questioned how lower levels of vitamin D might affect the character of infection and sickness, and is an aspect of the reasoning for genetic factors explaining the mentioned statistics. What if, however, the reason for this overrepresentation of some immigrant groups is to be explained by social factors? What if this actually represents a societal problem of our immigration system, that might be resolved by improved understanding of different cultures' risk perception and acceptance?

**2. Possible explanations for the phenomenon:  
Barriers and challenges of communicating with vulnerable groups**

The Corona Commission states: “_In science, still there is no agreement of why immigrants are so strongly overrepresentated in Covid infections''_ (NOU, 2022, p. 394) listing 14 aspects of relevance in explaining the problem. This paper concerns the topic of risk communication, therefore limiting the discussion to aspects related to communication challenges:

● _Language skills_: Starting with the most obvious barrier, research states that large numbers of immigrants consider their Norwegian skills as poor (NOU, 2022). ● _Digital competence:_ Large numbers of immigrants are considered to have low competence in digital solutions (NOU, 2022), this unveiling a barrier related to navigating through and finding information.

● _Frame of reference, affiliation and media use_: Immigrants may use information channels differently than the population without immigrant backgrounds. There is a compound explanation behind this involving trust in media and government, leading to different habits regarding sources for information gathering. It is likely that immigrants will closely follow the media coverage from their country of origin (NOU, 2022). Norwegian media have emphasized the severity of the pandemic and the infection rates - This might not be the case from early on in other countries, therefore potentially leading to a delayed understanding within certain groups. This results in a delayed process of testing, isolating, infection tracing and quarantine, referred to as TISK in Norwegian.

Also socio-economic concerns are relevant as several immigrant groups are under less fortunate conditions: “_Immigrants rather often have lower education, income and cramped accomodations and professions less likely to be suitable for home office solutions_” (NOU, 2022, p. 394). The point regarding housing and profession may potentially lead to more virus exposure. When it comes to the level of education, this needs to be considered in the state communication strategy. “_(..) Less educated people may prefer simple and short messages; therefore, the risk communication messages to this group should contain more visual information to attract their high attention_” (Thanh & Tung, 2022, p. 13). We of course also find non-immigrants in this group of low education, however in general there is a very high level of education in Norway in international context - Which makes the public more likely to understand complex risk concepts and messages.

The report further addresses communication barriers in reaching out to minorities. FHI quickly translated the messages of the authorities to 18 languages (NOU, 2022), and eight additional languages later (FHI, 2022). However, translation alone is not enough. “_There are plenty of barriers related to who is interpreted as the sender, how the message is constructed, and what platforms used to spread the information_” (NOU, 2022, p. 396). Another factor of the conditions under a pandemic is the frequency of change and update in restrictions and recommendations. The messages were complex explaining an invisible hazard where groups that do not know the language well naturally will have difficulties following.

One vital communication barrier especially when communicating with Somali immigrants are their differences towards trust in written versus verbal communication. In other cultures the public may trust verbal communication through radio and digital channels as well as information from relatives and friends much rather than state written messanges (FHI, 2021). Also the use of social media is an important difference. The level of trust in the media of their country of origin might explain why some immigrants often more use social media as an information source to Covid (FHI, 2021).  
  
Another barrier of high relevance is the confusion between the authorities’ “recommendations” and “encouragements”. Several immigrant groups are from countries that practice a very different relationship with injunctions - a lower threshold to use force. “_(Certain immigrant groups) have assumed that it was acceptable to act in conflict with the recommendations, because they thought if the recommendations were of high importance, the state would rather give an injunction_” (NOU, 2022, p. 397). Managing this balance is extremely challenging, but you may argue this is rather a matter of integration. Norway is an individualistic culture where the public is used to an open society with freedom of will. You may say the handling of the pandemic in such a society was based on freedom under responsibility encouraging solidarity.

Engen et al. (2020) raises the question of how the pandemic might have changed the public’s willingness to be protected from hazards. Immigrant groups might have a different perception of to what degree is acceptable for the government to actively protect them. This is not a topic of the Corona Commission report though it is a matter related to public trust in government.

Societal challenges of this scale rarely have a singular reason, handling the covid-pandemic is a matter of high complexity, ambiguity and uncertainty. “_The Covid pandemic presses all the red buttons”_ (Aven, 2021 personal communication (lecture notes)). Experiences from the pandemic confirmed how a wide set of measures have a significantly larger impact on the infection rates than a singular (NOU, 2022). Leading us to the fact that a built system is more effective than campaigns.

**3. Unexpected challenge of risk communicating to certain immigrant groups  
**When analyzing the Corona Commission report part two, a rather unexpected challenge in risk communication to immigrant groups unfolds. And this challenge is not necessarily characterized by the cultural differences but rather by the judgment of state and municipal actors. The report actually uncovered that in several cases the actors were reluctant to initiate measures targeting groups of the population with immigrant backgrounds. Concerns about stigmation of certain immigrant groups led to this act of reluctance based on the undesired consequence that these groups would “close off” if they felt exposed to negative attention (NOU, 2022).  
In reality the Corona Commission concludes that ”_the desire to treat everyone equally actually led to some immigrant groups receiving a worse offer than they should have had_“ (NOU, 2022, p. 407). This referring to for example a period of high infection cases in Stovner Oslo, which has a high percentage of the population from AfAsSa (Africa, Asia, South America), the municipality hesitated to initiate the necessary measures. Implementation of mobile Covid testing hubs was not initiated as it was for other parts of Oslo (NOU, 2022). The fear of stigmatizing immigrant groups based on the high infection rates in the groups led to hesitation.

Equality is a cornerstone in Norwegian society. All groups of the population are ideally to have the same opportunities, and the differences in income and social status are remarkably small in an international context. This is one of many reasons behind the high public trust that is special for Scandinavia. Treating vulnerable groups of the population with the same level of respect and dignity has also played an important role in governmental communication during the Covid pandemic.

The report of April 2022 explains factors why the Norwegian Model has overall worked so well: “_The population in Norway stands out in international contexts in that we have high confidence in each other and in the authorities_” (NOU, 2022, p. 445). The role of trust is important regardless of risk perspective: Trust may be seen as a filter for human risk response (Fjaeran & Aven, 2020). It is decisive for the perception of risk, and shape of response to the decision-makers.

Immigrant organizations were not included in the work of risk communication like voluntary organizations were trusted with communication responsibility (NOU, 2022). This raises the question of the trust-relationship between immigrant organizations and state, municipality - If this might be a factor why this relationship in regards of communication collaboration efforts was not initiated. This without further addressing it because of this paper's limitations in length.

At the other end of the communication link between state, municipality actors and the immigration organizations, we need to address the perspective of the immigrant organizations. In short, the Corona Commission found that resource persons from these groups did not act in reluctance when met with the mentioned statistics (NOU, 2022). Rather, FHI actually states that these organizations would be happy to help communicate the messages of the authorities. Clearly the state actors did not balance this concern of 023stigmatization in an efficient manner.

This could actually have been a great opportunity, in the long term view, for connecting state and municipality with immigrant organizations leading to an even more integrated society. Koval et al. (2021) states that there is a need for an in-depth understanding of fears, health-care needs and challenges before and during pandemics to improve the risk communication to these immigrant groups. This could be, as the Corona Commission suggests, pursuited through a closer communication relationship between state and municipality with immigrant organizations. As it appears in their conclusion, some immigrant cultures may have more trust in verbal communication than written. This identifies the importance of reaching out to these organizations with local contact persons that may pass on the state risk communication. Their trust in governmentality is also a vital challenge that this communication structure may ease the level of ambiguity. “_A lot may be accomplished by being actively engaged with these groups, for instance, through elected leaders in communities, trusted spokespersons and channels, as well as national and local organizations representing such groups_” (Koval et al., 2021). This emphasizes the power of knowledge in multiculturality: Deeper understanding of risk perception and response in other cultures will lead to a more trustworthy dual-way communication. Drawing a line on a larger scale, better communication structures may lead to better integration of immigrants, further leading to less undesired consequences (lower infection rates), and therefore resulting in a safer society.

**4. The unfolding of an immigration system problem  
**One of the very interesting concluding lines of the Corona Commission emphasizes the importance of interdisciplinarity. “_The review shows how the health administration knows too little about immigration and integration, while the integration administration knows too little about heath_” (NOU, 2022, p. 404).

The hesitation to implement the measures described actually presents a deeper and larger problem of our immigration system. The actors’ hesitations support the argument that state and municipal actors do not have sufficient knowledge about immigrant culture factors and their approach to trustworthiness. Sufficient knowledge of the receiving actors is essential for a successful risk communication. The report unveils a vital vulnerability of the Norwegian authorities’ risk communication. Here not referring to the main problem that there was no established system of crisis communication for vulnerable immigrant groups. In fact, the authorities lack the knowledge of how minorities actually live their life and perceive governmental communication. Lacking this understanding of possible information barriers have contributed to a more skewed set of consequences between the different population groups (NOU, 2022).

In risk science terminology, the findings from the Corona Commission unveils that certain immigrant groups have a different risk acceptance level, risk perception and relation to the concept of trust.

**5. Concluding remarks  
**Regarding the problem statement, this paper has mainly focused on the weaknesses and mistakes of the Norwegian Authorities’ pandemic communication to vulnerable immigrant groups. Understanding the overrepresentation of infection rates within certain groups has teached us a valuable lesson. In summary this involves cultural factors, and knowledge of the lifestyle and relationship to trust, that especially Asian and African immigrant groups differentiate to Norwegian standards. This calls for a different communication structure in reaching these citizens by making use of close contact with immigrant organizations. The pandemic has uncovered “pockets of outsidership” (NOU, 2022) in our society. This applies to population groups that have only a few contact points with Norwegian society and therefore are in need of different methods in order to inform about hazards. It also teaches us the consequences of miscalculating the mentioned balance of too much and too little effort of initiating measures for specific immigrant groups. Unfortunately the Corona Commission unveils how hesitation in fear of stigmatizing these groups have led to an increase in differences.
